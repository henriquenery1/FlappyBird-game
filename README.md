# Flappy Bird

This is a version of the Flappy Bird game

## About
This game is inspired by the original Flappy Bird and the tutorial series on the Dev Soutinho YouTube channel. You can find the tutorial playlist

I've made some modifications to the game mechanics, particularly adjusting the gravity and spacing of the pipes

## How to Play
Simply tap or click to make the bird flap its wings and navigate through the gaps between the pipes. Your goal is to fly as far as possible without hitting any obstacles.
